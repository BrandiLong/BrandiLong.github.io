        <h1>Amusing Internet Entertainment</h1>
        <p>The internet has a variety of entertainment.  Games, videos, movies, news, blogs, you name it and it's on the internet.</p>

        <h2>Maze Toys</h2>
        <p>I like this website because it doesn't take a lot of energy or brain power. It is a simple maze with different level options as you complete each one.</p>

        <h2><em>2048</em></h2>
        <p>2048 is a fun math game that I have been playing since I was a little kid. Not only is it available through the link below but there is also a mobile app, which I prefer to use.</p>

        <h2>Pinterest</h2>
        <p>Although I use the Pinterest app more than the website, they both show the same content and work the same. I love pinterest for nail design ideas, recipies to try for dinner, gift ideas, etc. Pinterest has so much more to offer than what I use it for! :</p>
