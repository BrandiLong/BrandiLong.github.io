        <h3>Ways To Give</h3>
           <p>
            At the Weld Food Bank there are three ways to give: time, money, and food. They need your help to make a difference in our community where 1 out of 4 people go hungry. This means around 88,000 people in our community are needing food assistance. 26,000 of that number is children in need as 1 out of 3 children need food assistance.
            The Weld Food Bank wants to serve those in Weld County through various methods including: their mobile food pantry, kids summer backpacks program, senior feeding program, school food pantries, emergency food program, farms to families, and the kids cafe after school program.
