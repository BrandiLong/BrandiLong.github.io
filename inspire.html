<h2>What is a hero?</h2>
<p>Heros are people that are admirable, selfless, determined, corageous, etc. By the definition alone I am assuming someone signifigant in your life pops up in your mind. </p>
<p>I would say multiple people come to mind when I think about who my hero is, but the main hero in my life is God. I have always been a believer of God and it impacts my daily life for the better. Although I am still working on getting to know Him and building a relationship with Him, He has saved my life multiple times, which is why I consider Him my hero.</p>
